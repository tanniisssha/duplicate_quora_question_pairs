The Duplicate Quora Question Pairs project aims to identify whether two questions on Quora have the same meaning, even if phrased differently. 
It involves analyzing text data to detect semantic similarity using techniques like natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. 
By preprocessing the text, extracting features, and applying models, the system determines if a pair of questions is a duplicate.
